# Facial Recognition System
## 1. Project Overveiw
This project contains the implementation of Facial Recognition System that identifies people using interpretable machine learning techniques. The System uses techniques like LBP, SIFT, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and k-NN to train the model.

## 2. Objective
Our core objective is to develop a transparent, and interpretable facial recognition system that performs person identification with high accuracy and also giving insights into why a particular decision is made, making the model more interpretable.

## 3. Project Structure
1. **Placing "faces.zip":** Ensure that your zip file, "faces.zip" is present in the same root directory of your project.

## 4. Features
1. Face Detection is done using Haar Cascades.
2. Feature extraction is done using LBPs, SIFT, and HOGs.
3. Feature fusion was done for robust representation.
4. Machine Learning classifiers were used, like, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM, and k-NN.
5. Interpretability tools like Confusion Matrices, and EDA were also used.

## 5. How to Run the Project
1. git clone **Link of github repository**
   cd your-repository-name
2. Install all required libraries bit **pip install *LIBRARY_NAME***
3. Place the faces.zip folder in the same folder as your project
4. Run the notebook

## 6. Ethical Considerations
This project is for academic and education purposes. The authors must be conntacted in case of reusing the project in any other domain.
